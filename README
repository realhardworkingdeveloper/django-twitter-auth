NAME
	Django Twitter Auth -- a safe way for 3rd parties to auth with Twitter

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
	Until Twitter supports OAuth, this is the best way I can think of to
	verify a Twitter user's credentials without asking for their password.

	It works by first having the app's Twitter user follow the
	authenticating user and then sending the authenticating user to a
	URL that will direct message the app's user a known and random
	hash.  The process has some UI flaws because of XSS protections that
	browsers put in place.

	The process:
		1.	Ask the authenticating user for their Twitter username.
		2.	Present the authenticating user with an <iframe> containing
			a form that will send a direct message from them to the
			app's user.  When clicked, the browser's HTTP Authentication
			dialog will appear to get the authenticating user's Twitter
			credentials.
		3.	After a short delay to make sure the <iframe>'s request went
			through, the page is refreshed via JavaScript and the direct
			message is verified.

INSTALLATION
	Clone/download and place in the root of your Django project.  You'll
	need to add this app to your settings.py file in the INSTALLED_APPS
	section.  You'll also need these two extra lines:

		TWITTERAUTH_USERNAME = 'OH HAI'
		TWITTERAUTH_PASSWORD = 'OH NOES'

	Setup the URLs for the auth app.  The names of the URLs are required.
	For example:

		url(r'^info/?$', 'auth.views.info', name='auth_info'),
		url(r'^login/?$', 'auth.views.login', name='auth_login'),
		url(r'^login/dm/?$', 'auth.views.dm', name='auth_dm'),
		url(r'^logout/?$', 'auth.views.logout', name='auth_logout'),

	Again, the names of the URLs are required.  I chose not to create
	auth/urls.py because URLs like /auth/login et cetera seems awful.

	Make sure to run `python manage.py syncdb` to create the User model.
